# latency

``latency`` is intended to be a web proxy for introducing latency to services.
It's inspired by Netflix concept of latency monkey. And is designed to sit
in between a reverse proxy (like nginx proxy) and a "publicly" exposed API.

The project is nowhere near being finished or production ready. If you like the
idea please feel free to contribute. Hopefully, I'll finish this sooner than
later and that it will be a  blog post about it.

Happy hacking!
